# Lilith's Development EasyRef

## An "Easy reference guide" and class notebook 
A repository for my notes, useful snippets of code, definitions, and other information learned on the Coding Bootcamp.

- Inspired by the "Prework Study Guide" assigment.
- Built to help my eager learning.
- Solves the problem of storing every single required command in my own brain.  

### I learnt 
- how to style the page to make it attractive and easy to use - specifically for myself, in this instance.
- how to make html & other code actually display on a webpage, instead of being interpreted as code.
- rainbows are cool.
- git & git flow
- beginners markdown
